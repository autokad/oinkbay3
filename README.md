## GEMS

### Gem: Leter Opener
1 Whats it for?

ии* Enables me to preview email without needing to send it or have an email delivery system.

3 Documentation:

*https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener/blob/master/README.rdoc

### Gem: devise
1 Whats it for?

..* Highly tested and community approved user and authorization management.
2 see it work:

..* simply log in, sign up, use password retrieval, etc

3 Documentation:

..* https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/README.md

### Gem: omniauth-facebook
1 Whats it for?

* Enables users to log in oinkbay and authenticate through facebook.  It also scrapes email, first name, last name, etc and puts it into their user profile.
2 see it work:

* Simply click the 'login with facebook' button.  I gather user profile information and stick it into the users database, such as email, first/last name.  This can be verified by going to edit - user profile.* Note, due to limitations with facebook applications which is required for authorizing through facebook, a specific domain name must be used in order to work.  For this reason, you must use it through www.oinkbay.com

3 Documentation:

* https://github.com/mkdynamic/omniauth-facebook/blob/master/README.md

### Gem: aws-sdk
1 Whats it for?

* Enables me to host my images/pins on Amazon's S3 Service.  The functionalities are greater then that, however I only need this particular service due to heroku limitations.
* 
2 see it work:

* Right click on an image/pin and select copy image URL (chrome).  Notice the URL is hosted on Amazon S3
http://s3.amazonaws.com/autobucket/pins/images/000/000/016/medium/jeeppig.jpg?1376515523

### Gem: make_voteable
1 Whats it for?

* makes managing a user like/disliking system easier than coding one myself.  When a user liked something, in this case images/pins, the like value for that user and that pin goes up.  Likewise for dis-liking.  If a person likes something and clicks dislike, the like is automatically removed and the dislikes is incremented to 1, visa versa.  A user can only like or dislike something once.

2 see it work:

* log in to www.oinkbay.com.  Navigate to the gallery or to a particular image/pin.  Click the like or dislike and notice the change in likes/dislikes.

### Gem: rack-google-analytics
1 Whats it for?

* Makes it easy to install GA.  It also makes it easy to run GA only in production, so testing doesnt skew hits.
2 see it work:

* Since you cannot view my GA, I included a link to a screen shot. http://www.oinkbay.com/assets/GA.jpg

3 Documentation:

* https://github.com/kangguru/rack-google-analytics/blob/master/README.md

### Gem: will_paginate
1 Whats it for?

* Enables things to paginate, in my case images/pins.  Otherwise, ALL the images/pins would show up on one page which could slow one's computer down.  This way, users can page through the gallery at their leisure.
2 see it work:

* Notice in the gallery that it automagically creates pages when there are too many images/pins.

### Gem: bootstrap-will_paginate
1 Whats it for?
